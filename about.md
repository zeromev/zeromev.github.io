# about us

Zeromev is an organization that aims to protect Ethereum users from [frontrunning](#frontrunning) and [censorship](#censorship).

Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been lost by users to such exploits, which is often called Miner Extractable Value (MEV).

We aim to:

*   __Empower Users__ by providing information to help users understand and avoid harmful MEV.
*   __Protect Users__ by researching and advocating for genuinely preventative protocol level solutions.

We have been funded with a grant from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://www.ethereum.org).

Our flagship product is the [Zeromev Frontrunning Explorer](/explorer#frontrunning-explorer) which gives users and researchers detailed information on [transaction reordering](#transaction-reordering) and [MEV](#miner-extractable-value).

Zeromev was founded by the pseudo-anonymous researcher [pmcgoohan](https://twitter.com/pmcgoohanCrypto) who first alerted the community to the vulnerability we now call MEV in their 2014 post [Miners Frontrunning](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2d84yv/miners_frontrunning).
