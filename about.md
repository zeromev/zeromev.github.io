# about us

Zeromev is an organization that aims to [protect](/wayforward) Ethereum users from [frontrunning](/terms#frontrunning) and [censorship](/terms#censorship).

Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been lost by users to such exploits, which is often called [Miner Extractable Value](/terms#miner-extractable-value) (MEV).

We aim to:

*   __Empower Users__ by providing information to help users understand and [avoid harmful MEV](/wayforward).
*   __Protect Users__ by researching and advocating for solutions.

We have been funded with a grant from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://www.ethereum.org).

Our flagship product is the [zeromev frontrunning explorer](/explorer) which gives users and researchers detailed information on [transaction reordering](/terms#transaction-reordering) and [MEV](/terms#miner-extractable-value).

We also offer [Zeromev-Geth](/zmgeth), an alternative execution client for validators wishing to protect users from frontrunning and the network from harmful centralization.

You can now access our data freely via the [Zeromev API](/api).

Zeromev was founded by the pseudo-anonymous researcher [pmcgoohan](https://twitter.com/pmcgoohanCrypto) who first alerted the community to the vulnerability we now call MEV in their 2014 post [miners frontrunning](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2d84yv/miners_frontrunning).
